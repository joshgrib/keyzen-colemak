## Changes

### Completed

- [x] Reorder character to put symbols before capitals

### Planned

- [/] Remake with Vue
- [ ] Flash background red on errors so you have feedback when the sound is off
- [ ] Add error counts for each character, maybe some charts

### Under consideration

- [ ] Add a way to store and choose from different "alphabets" to practice with
    - Maybe different orders of the characters, or to practice more on a subset
- [ ] Add a way to paste text (or ideally code with syntax highlighting) and practice with that
- [ ] Change to use an array of characters so you could put it entire words and practice with a set of words
